# hello-world V1

Hello world! This is my first edit. Over the past couple years I have been struggling to find a suitable career. I started learned JAVA syntax this year in 2020 and wish to pursue a career in programming!

Here is a little timeline I have set for myself updated as of Jan 3th, 2021:

- By Febuary 1st I will be finished the HEAD FIRST and HTML and CSS book
  -learn positioning
  -alignment (flexbox and CSS grid)
  -Transitions and animations
  -Responsive design/media queries
- Build simple projects with what I have learned (Static webpages = brochure for my favourite resturant Uncle Willies!)

Then I will:
- Learn sass
- Learn Tailwind CSS for everything /jackra for react (frameworks for CSS)
- Finish the HEAD FIRST JAVASCRIPT book.
- Register for TeamTreeHouse web deve bootcamp?
- Build a Pomodoro Timer similar to https://pomofocus.io/
- Build an EBIKE E-Commerce website similar to what can be achieved with Shopify. Similar to https://lectricebikes.com/. Include a mailing list     and contact function.
- Learn JavaScript libraries like React, NodeJS, Angular, AWS?
- Understand Data Structures and Algorithims?

Part of the reason why I want to learn programing to is to build my own embedded systems. 

A couple projects I have in mind are:

- A doorbell that connects to my phone with speaker function
- Automatic light switch from my phone
- Automatic door opener
- Automatic Range shut-off or warning

Other projects:

- Link my compass card to my phone
